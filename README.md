### Practical Guidelines
1. Write a prolog program to calculate the sum of two numbers.
2. Write a prolog program to implement max(X,Y,M), so that M is the maximum of two numbers X and Y.
3. Write a program in prolog to implement factorial(N,F) where F represents the factorial of a number N.
4. Write a prolog program to implement generate_fib(N,T) where T represents the Nth term of the fibonacci series.
5. Write a prolog program to implement GCD of two numbers.
6. Write a prolog program to implement power(Num,Pow,Ans): where Num is raised to the Pow to get Ans.
7. Write a prolog program to implement multi(N1,N2,R): where N1 and N2 denotes the numbers to be multiplied and R represents the result.
8. Write a prolog program to implement towerofhanoi(N) where N represents the number of discs.
9. Consider a cyclic directed graph[edge(p,q),edge(q,r),edge(q,s),edge(s,t)] where edge(A,B) is a prediccate indicating directed edge in a graph from a node A to a node B. Write a program to check whether there is a route from one node to another node.
 11. Write a prolog program to implement conc(L1,L2,L3) where L2 is the list to be appended with L1 to get the resulted list L3.
12. Write a prolog program to implement reverse(L,R),were List L is original and Lisr R is reversed list.
13. Write a prolog program to implement palindrome(L) which checks whether a list L is a palindrome or not.
14. Write a prolog program to implement sumlist(L,S) so that S is the sum of the given list L.
15. Write a prolog program to implement two predicates evenlength(list) and oddlenght(List) so that
